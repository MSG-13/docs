# Join MSG Gaang

## How to join

You have two options...

### GHST Tribute

350 GHST = 1 Share

Additional tributes in increments of 350 GHST will be credited with LOOT.

### Land Parcel Tribute

- Humble = 1 Share
- Reasonable = 1 Share + 1 Loot
- Spacious = 1 Share + 1 Loot

#### Tribute Adjustments

Tribute amount changes will be triggered via DAO vote.

We are currently discussing adjustments in [this forum thread.](https://forum.daohaus.club/t/adjust-the-land-parcel-ghst-share-ratio-msg/9532)

### Why Shares and Loot?

Shares determine voting weight/power within the DAO.

Each member should receive no more than 1 share total for their tributes.

Members are credited with Loot for additional tributes to reward the user for their contribution to the DAO without skewing the democratic voting scheme.
